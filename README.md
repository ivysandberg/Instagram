Instagram Data


Goals: increase reach & increase pool of long term clients/viewers (last ring on the marketing funnel)
Steps: Clear brand message & concise knowledge as where your long term clients are

Case: Does incorporating video in instagram stories put me in the right direction & does the follower data tell me anything about viewers?



1.
Viewer demographics & interests:
acquisition (organic, paid, social, marketing efforts, shared by friends, etc.)
geography
age group
gender
view time


2.
comparison to competitors:
if someone likes your video, who else do they follow in the same market space?
can we compare …
	page views
	number of people watch through to the end
	click through rate
	shares

could we share the average #likes/shares/views for that market?

do this by having every client identify themselves as being in a particular market category and collect the data per category and share with our clients
Downfalls this only applies to people in our clients if we could pull data from facebook, bc facebook requires this sort of identification that would make our results more accurate. 

easily comparable: delta in followers/subscribers

want to know where they lie in the distribution of the industry

“people like them” is a nice feature, especially for growing brands.


3. 
Notify of key changes
delta in followers/subscribers
progression in the industry
view rate up/down %



questions:
information to identify what to build —
 who are the users? 
 market size? 
 how competitive is the market? 
 size of the company’s audience 
  (deciphering the impact on a relatively small audience is different than that of a very large audience)
	small: comments, sharing, easier to study the audience in more depth, niche audience 
	large: looking at numbers, overall growth, viewership


what features would you build?
timeline w social activity


how would the feature look & function?
see sketch


How would you know if what you designed was successful?
From my data I see that an increase in stories correlated to an increase in followers. If I continue to actively post stories do I move up in the distribution of my industry?


ideas:
timeline include your social activity (ie. post dates), not just the follower activity. Easier for the user to visualize than trying to remember when they did what, and then they can see the impact of their efforts.
